Release highlights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



Additional new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lots of new features for the neural network based reductors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#1559] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1559>`_, a couple of new features
including support for learning rate schedulers, input and output scaling,
regularization of weights and biases, a weighted MSE loss and logging of current
losses have been added to improve the training of neural networks. These additions
make the training process more flexible and all components can be combined as required.

Purely data-driven usage of neural network based reductors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If no full-order model is available but only snapshot data, it is now also possible to
use the neural network based reductors in a data-driven way.
In `[#1679] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/1679>`_, the reductors have been
adjusted to allow for pairs of parameters and corresponding snapshot data as training
set instead of only parameters. The resulting surrogate models can be used as before.


Backward incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dropped Python 3.7 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following numpy/scipy we have dropped official support for
Python 3.7. This means pyMOR now requires Python 3.8 to install
and is no longer tested against for 3.7.

Further notable improvements
